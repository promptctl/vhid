/// twice, and what separates them is configuration - a bundle identifier, a Mach service,
/// a launchd label, a file to read. So this is one type with two instances rather than a
/// `#if DEBUG` seam through the code, and no caller ever branches on which it holds: it
/// asks the value for the name it needs. [LAW:dataflow-not-control-flow]
///
/// **Why these particular names and no others.** Each entry below is a namespace macOS
/// itself enforces uniqueness in, and sharing any one of them is what makes the second
/// copy fail rather than run:
///
/// - the bundle identifier, which LaunchServices treats as the app's identity and TCC
///   keys Microphone, Accessibility and Input Monitoring grants to;
/// - the Mach service, which exactly one process may own;
/// - the launchd label, which Background Task Management files the approval record under;
/// - the config file, so a setting changed for one build does not move the other.
///
/// Nothing else needs to differ by flavor. The model store differs too, but by whether
/// the bundle carries one, not by this type: a release loads the store it carries in place,
/// read-only, and a development build downloads into Application Support.
///

/// - a root daemon that must stay lean - and the app's higher layers read from one source
