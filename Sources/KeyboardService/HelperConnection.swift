/// user's own process against types that know nothing about privilege.

/// the second refused as busy by the first. [LAW:one-source-of-truth]
///
/// Synchronous on purpose. Each call waits for the helper's acknowledgement before the
/// next report goes out, because reports posted back to back are lost in the driver and a
/// lost key-up leaves a key held for macOS to repeat. The waiting is not a sleep: the
/// daemon answers every request, and the answer is what the pacing is built on.
///
/// Callable from any thread: the connection is, and each call keeps what it is waiting on
/// in an `Outcome` of its own, so two callers on two threads share nothing but the wire.
