/// What crosses the privilege boundary: a key goes down and every key comes up; a button
/// goes down and every button comes up; the pointer moves by counts and the wheel rolls.
///
/// The driver extension takes commands from root alone, so the process that owns the
/// devices is not the process that decides what to type or where to click. This protocol
/// is the whole of what passes between them, and it is deliberately the smallest thing
/// that can work.
///
/// **It cannot express text, and that is the point.** [LAW:types-are-the-program] macOS
/// turns a HID usage into a character using the console user's keyboard layout, and Text
/// Input Sources answers per process: with this Mac switched to Dvorak, the console user
/// is told `com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak` and the same call under `sudo` is told
/// `com.apple.keylayout.US`. A helper handed text would look up the keys with root's
/// layout and type something else entirely - measured, and every check still passed,
/// because the daemon acknowledged every report and the screen held what had been typed.
/// A helper that cannot be handed text cannot make that mistake.
///
/// **It cannot express a place on the screen either, for the same shape of reason.** The
/// device knows deltas, and macOS accelerates them: where the pointer lands after a report
/// is a fact of the window server in the user's session, which a root daemon cannot read.
/// So absolute motion is the client's loop - post a delta, read the cursor back, repeat -
/// and only deltas cross.
///
/// **One report per call, and the client decides when.** The daemon acknowledges reports
/// the driver then drops: twelve 500-character runs, each report awaited, six of which
/// landed fewer keys than were acknowledged - as few as 469 of 500. The only delivery
/// receipt is the event tap, which runs in the user's session and not here. So a method
/// shaped `type(_ text: String)` would swallow a whole burst inside the helper, which has
/// no way to observe the loss and would answer "typed" to a client that got 608
/// characters. The pacing lives with the process that can see what landed.
///
/// **The focus check does not cross.** Which app is frontmost, and whether the operator
/// interrupted, are facts of the user's session that a root daemon cannot read. They stay
/// on the client, which is why this carries no "type into" argument: the helper types
/// wherever the keyboard is pointed, exactly as hardware does, and deciding that is the
/// client's job. [LAW:one-way-deps]
///
/// The integers are the wire's: a usage is the 16 bits of the report, a button is its
/// number, a count is the signed byte the report carries. The wire admits values the
/// device has no bit or count for - button 0 and 33 upward, and -128 - and the helper
/// refuses those by name rather than folding them. [LAW:parse-dont-validate]
