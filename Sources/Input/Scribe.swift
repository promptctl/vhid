/// can be driven and read rather than two variables in a run loop.
///
/// Every method that awaits takes the caller's isolation, so the value stays on the actor
/// the run is driven from rather than being sent across a boundary between keystrokes.
/// That is what lets it be a mutable struct at all: there is one owner, and it is whoever
