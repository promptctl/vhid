/// Where a device call waits for its acknowledgement: a serial queue of its own, off the

/// A report to the keyboard or the mouse blocks the thread it is made on until the far
/// side answers, and that wait is the pacing the driver needs, so it stays; what moves is
/// the thread. On the caller's own actor it held that actor for as long as the insert took
/// - ten seconds for a long sentence - so anything else that actor was responsible for
/// waited with it; the app this was written in lost its keyboard tap that way, and macOS
/// switches off a tap that cannot be heard. On the cooperative pool it would hold one of
/// the few threads the rest of the process runs on, which is how `HelperKeyboardTests`
/// once starved a three-core runner. A queue nothing else runs on is the one place the
/// wait holds up nobody. [LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling]
///
/// Serial, and one shared by the keyboard and the mouse a client posts through, because
/// the helper takes their reports as one sequence: two in flight at once would be ordered
/// by its lock rather than by the order they were asked in. A value handed to both rather
/// than a static, so one client never waits on another's. [LAW:no-shared-mutable-globals]
